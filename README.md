By default all scripts on a webpage are allowed to send and fetch data to any site they want. This can be a security problem. Imagine one of your JavaScript dependencies sends all keystrokes, including passwords, to a third party website.

It's very easy for someone to hide this malicious behaviour, making it nearly impossible for you to detect it (unless you manually read all the JavaScript code on your site). For a better idea of why you really need to set content security policy headers read [this excellent blog post](https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5) by [David Gilbertson](https://twitter.com/D__Gilbertson).

Setting Content Security Policy headers heps solve this problem. These headers dictate which sites your site is allowed to contact. This package makes it easy for you to set the right headers.

This readme does not aim to fully explain all the possible usages of CSP and it's directives. We highly recommend that you read [Mozilla's documentation on the Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)) before using this package.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require spatie/laravel-csp
```

You can publish the config-file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Csp\CspServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the file which will be published at `config/csp.php`:

```php
return [

    /*
     * A CSP profile will determine which CSP headers will be set. A valid CSP profile is
     * any class that extends `Spatie\Csp\Profiles\Profile`
     */
    'profile' => Spatie\Csp\Profiles\Basic::class,

    /*
     * This profile which will be put in report only mode. This is great for testing out
     * a new profile or changes to existing csp policy without breaking anyting.
     */
    'report_only_profile' => '',

    /*
     * All violations against the CSP policy will be reported to this url.
     * A great service you could use for this is https://report-uri.com/
     *
     * You can override this setting by calling `reportTo` on your profile.
     */
    'report_uri' => env('CSP_REPORT_URI', ''),

    /*
     * Headers will only be added if this setting is set to true.
     */
    'enabled' => env('CSP_ENABLED', true),

    /*
     * The class responsible for generating the nonces used in inline tags and headers.
     */
    'nonce_generator' => Spatie\Csp\Nonce\RandomString::class,
];
```

You can add CSP headers to all responses of your app by registering `Spatie\Csp\AddCspHeaders::class` in the http kernel.

```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php

...

protected $middlewareGroups = [
   'web' => [
       ...
       \Spatie\Csp\AddCspHeaders::class,
   ],
```
 
Alternatively you can apply the middleware on the route or route group level.

```php
// in a routes file

Route::get('my-page', 'MyController')->middleware(Spatie\Csp\AddCspHeaders::class);
```

You can also pass a profile class as a parameter to the middleware:
 
```php
// in a routes file

Route::get('my-page', 'MyController')->middleware(Spatie\Csp\AddCspHeaders::class . ':' . MyProfile::class);
``` 

The given profile will override the one configured in the config file for that specific route or group of routes.

## Usage

This package allows you to define CSP profiles. A CSP profile determines which CSP directives will be set in the headers of the response. 

An example of a CSP directive is `script-src`. If this has the value `'self' www.google.com` then your site can only load scripts from it's own domain of `www.google.com`. You'll find [a list with all CSP directives](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#csp-directives) at Mozilla's excellent developer site.

According to the spec certain directive values need to be surrounded by quotes. Examples of this are `'self'`, `'none'` and `'unsafe-inline'`. When using `addDirective` function you're not required to surround the directive value with quotes manually. We will automatically add quotes.

```php
// in a profile
...
   ->addDirective(Directive::SCRIPT, 'self') // will output `'self'` when outputting headers
...
```

### Creating profiles

In the `profile` key of the `csp` config file is set to `\Spatie\Csp\Profiles\Basic::class` by default. This class allows your site to only use images, scripts, form actions of your own site. This is how the class looks like.

```php
namespace Spatie\Csp\Profiles;

use Spatie\Csp\Directive;

class Basic extends Profile
{
    public function configure()
    {
        $this
            ->addDirective(Directive::CONNECT, 'self')
            ->addDirective(Directive::DEFAULT, 'self')
            ->addDirective(Directive::FORM_ACTION, 'self')
            ->addDirective(Directive::IMG, 'self')
            ->addDirective(Directive::MEDIA, 'self')
            ->addDirective(Directive::SCRIPT, 'self')
            ->addDirective(Directive::STYLE, 'self')
            ->addDirective(Directive::OBJECT, 'none')
            ->addNonceForDirective(Directive::SCRIPT)
            ->addNonceForDirective(Directive::STYLE);
    }
}
```

You can allow fetching scripts from `www.google.com` by extending this class:

```php
namespace App\Services\CspProfiles;

use Spatie\Csp\Directive;
use Spatie\Csp\Profiles\Profile;

class MyCustomProfile extends Profile
{
    public function configure()
    {
        parent::configure();
        
        $this->addDirective(Directive::SCRIPT, 'www.google.com');
    }
}
```

Don't forget to set the `profile` key in the `csp` config file to the class name of your profile (in this case it would be `App\Services\CspProfiles\MyCustomProfile`).

### Using inline scripts and styles

When using CSP you must specifically allow the use of inline scripts or styles. The recommended way of doing that with this package is to use a `nonce`. A nonce is a number that iss unique per request. The nonce must be specified in the CSP headers and in an attribute on the html tag. This way an attacker has no way of injecting malicious scripts or styles.

First you must add the nonce to the right directives in your profile:

```php
// in a profile

public function configure()
  {
      $this
        ->addDirective(Directive::SCRIPT, 'self')
        ->addDirective(Directive::STYLE, 'self')
        ->addNonceForDirective(Directive::SCRIPT)
        ->addNonceForDirective(Directive::STYLE)
        ...
}
```

Next you must add the nonce to the html:

```
{{-- in a view --}}
<style nonce="{{ cspNonce() }}">
   ...
</style>

<script nonce="{{ cspNonce() }}">
   ...
</script>
```

There are few other options to use inline styles and scripts. Take a look at the [CSP docs on the Mozilla developer site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) to know more.


### Reporting CSP errors

#### In the browser

Instead of outright blocking all violations you can put a profile in report only mode. In this case all requests will be made, but all violations will display in your favourite browser's console.

To put a profile in report only mode just call `reportOnly()` in the `configure()` function of a report:

```php
    public function configure()
    {
        parent::configure();
        
        $this->reportOnly();
    }
```

#### To an external url

Any violations against to the policy can be reported to a given url. You can set that url in the `report_uri` key of the `csp` config file. A great service that is specifically built for handling these violation reports is [http://report-uri.io/](http://report-uri.io/). 

#### Using multiple profiles

To test changes to your CSP policy you can specify a second profile in the `report_only_profile` in the `csp` config key. The profile specified in `profile` will be enforced, the one in `report_only_profile` will not. This is great for testing a new profile or changes to existing CSP policy without breaking anything.

### Testing

You can run all the tests with:

```bash
composer test
```
